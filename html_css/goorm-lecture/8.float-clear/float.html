        Next week, my long-awaited summer vacation finally begins. This time, I'm going on a trip to the beach. I'm planning to walk along the shore in the cool sea breeze and enjoy delicious seafood dishes. My friends and I will learn to surf, and in the evenings, we'll have a campfire while stargazing. I'm already excited and hope to make many wonderful memories!
